## Running txAdmin
- Since early 2020, **txAdmin is a component of FXServer, so there is no need to downloading or installing anything**.
- To start txAdmin, simply run FXServer **without** any `+exec server.cfg` launch argument, and FXServer will automatically start txAdmin.
- On first boot, a `txData` directory will be created to store txAdmin files, and you will need to open the URL provided in the console to configure your account and server.

  
## Configuration & Integrations
- Most configuration can be done inside the txAdmin settings page, but some configs (such as TCP interface & port) are only available through  Environment Variables, please see [docs/env-config.md](docs/env-config.md).
- You can listen to server events broadcasted by txAdmin to allow for custom behavior in your resources, please see [docs/events.md](docs/events.md).


## Contributing & Development
- All PRs should be based on the develop branch, including translation PRs.
- Before putting effort for any significant PR, make sure to join our discord and talk to us, since the change you want to do might not have been done for a reason or there might be some required context.
- If you want to build it or run from source, please check [docs/development.md](docs/development.md).
